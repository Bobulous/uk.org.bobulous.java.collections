# uk.org.bobulous.java.collections
A package related to Java collections.

Currently contains a Combinatorics class which allows all possible combinations to be generated from a provided Set, either as an unordered Set or as a SortedSet which is ordered based on the SortedSetComparator which is also included in the package.

Relies on the uk.org.bobulous.java.intervals package (also available on my GitHub account).
