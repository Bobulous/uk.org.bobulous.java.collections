/**
 * A <code>Comparator</code> which compares two <code>SortedSet</code> instances
 * based on the number of elements in each set, and then on the natural ordering
 * of the elements in each set.
 * <p>
 * If set alpha contains fewer elements than set beta then
 * <code>compare(alpha, beta)</code> will return a negative integer; if alpha
 * contains a greater number of elements than beta then a positive integer will
 * be returned.</p>
 * <p>
 * If both sets alpha and beta have the same number of elements then the
 * elements of the two sets will be compared. If their first elements (based on
 * the ordering of the <code>SortedSet</code>) are different then a negative
 * integer will be returned if alpha's first element is considered to come
 * before beta's first element (based on the natural ordering of the element
 * type) and a positive integer will be returned if alpha's first element is
 * considered to come after beta's. If the first elements are both identical
 * then the second elements of the two sets are compared in the same way, and so
 * on. Only if both sets have an identical size and identical elements in the
 * same order will <code>compare(alpha, beta)</code> return zero.</p>
 * <p>
 * For example, when the two sets are of type SortedSet&lt;Character&gt; with
 * values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>alpha: {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}</li>
 * <li>beta: {'a', 'b', 'c'}
 * </ul>
 * then <code>compare(alpha, beta)</code> will return a positive integer because
 * alpha has a greater number of elements than beta. So the
 * <code>SortedSet</code> alpha is considered to come after the
 * <code>SortedSet</code> beta under the ordering defined by this
 * <code>Comparator</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As another example, when the two sets are of type SortedSet&lt;Integer&gt;
 * with values:
 * <ul>
 * <li>alpha: {5, 6, 7, 8}</li>
 * <li>beta: {5, 6, 7, 9}
 * </ul>
 * then <code>compare(alpha, beta)</code> will return a negative integer because
 * the two sets have an identical number of elements, and the first three
 * elements of the two sets have an identical value, but the value of the fourth
 * element of alpha is 8 which comes before the value 9 of beta's fourth
 * element. So the <code>SortedSet</code> alpha is considered to come before the
 * <code>SortedSet</code> beta under the ordering defined by this
 * <code>Comparator</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>SortedSetComparator</code> is <em>consistent with equals</em> so long
 * as the <code>compareTo</code> method of the element type <code>T</code> is
 * consistent with equals <strong>and</strong> both sets are ordered the same
 * way. If the two <code>SortedSet</code> instances were constructed with
 * different <code>Comparator</code> types which do not guarantee to return the
 * same result under the same conditions, then <code>SortedSetComparator</code>
 * will not be consistent with equals, because the two sets might contain
 * exactly the same elements but in a different order.</p>
 * <p>
 * If either of the <code>SortedSet</code> instances passed to the
 * <code>compare</code> method contains a <code>null</code> element then a
 * <code>NullPointerException</code> will be thrown. This is because
 * <code>null</code> is not an instance of any class and so cannot have a place
 * within the natural order of any type, and it is the natural order which is
 * used by <code>compare</code> to compare the two sets.</p>
